                For my most ambitious project yet, me and my group started a developer team during CreaTe's module 5: Interactive Media.
                We had the entire module (~3 months) to prepare for the final product, and about 2 weeks to fully code the game and make the final 3D models. 
                We ended up making a fully-fledged 3D action-puzzle game, called ChronoSyphonics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything in the game, except some sound effects, is self-made by me and the developer team. 
                This includes the font, all textures, the 2D intro animation, the coding and all 3D models and animations.
            </p>
            <p>
                We ended up winning the Audience Award for the study year, with the project grade ending up being a 9.4/10.

                The game currently features three levels, with the main twist being that you pay for your supplies with time. 
                The theme was “It's Not About Time” this year, therefore we chose for time to merely be a currency in our game. 
                If time allows (pun intended), we do plan on making more levels in the future.

            <h3>Description from the portfolio page</h3>
            <p>
                ChronoSyphonics is a shooter platformer with a tight timing twist. 
                You are a dispatched agent of ChronoSyphonics Inc., a technology megacorp that recently has been making mixed reality devices, designed to integrate seamlessly with users.
            </p>
            <p>
                After this, the devices fused too well—transforming its users into grotesque, Lovecraftian-like horrors. 
                Throughout your journey, you need to solve time-dependent puzzles and avoid contact with the gruesome monster-turned humans like the GunBlobs and JarBrains 
                in order to save the remaining survivors.
            </p>
                ChronoSyphonics was made by Harmen Ament, Joep Berghuis, Sam Hobbelink and Juray Klanderman, under the developer team name of Jumping Hippo Productions.
