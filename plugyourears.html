            <p>
                For the very first project I had for my study Creative Technology, the goal was to create a video which addresses some societal problem. 
                Based on psychological research me and my group members did, we found that many young adults don't bother to use earplugs at loud music events. 
                This is a big problem, as hearing problems such as tinnitus are on the rise, especially among this age group.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reasons for not wearing earplugs were ignorance, lack of perceived serverence of not using earplugs and group pressure. 
                With this video campaign, we wanted to stress the importance of using earplugs at loud music events. The video has a bit of a shock factor, 
                as the protagonist gets tinnitus at the end of the video, due to underestimating the severity of not wearing earplugs and giving in to group pressure from a friend.      
            </p>
            <p>
                This project taught me that a psychological analysis of your target group is crucial when designing an intervention campaign. 
                In addition, I had a lot of fun video editing and shooting the video from all the different angles (which we also had lectures about).
            </p>

                Due to privacy reasons, the full video is not viewable on my portfolio, however, some screenshots of the campaign can be seen below.
