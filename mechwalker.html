                During my studies' fifth module, we had to model a mechanical walking creature. It was based on a tutorial. However, to make the model suitable for games, we had to find ways to cut down on geometry to make it able to be run in real-time without lagging the computer. We also had to make a seamless walking cycle. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end, I was quite happy with the result. It took tens of hours to build, including all the modelling, texturing, rigging and animating. Everything was done by me from scratch!

            <p>
                Keep in mind that it is subject to YouTube's (not-great-looking) video compression, so it may not look as good as it would in a game.            
            </p>
            <p>
                The teachers based the tutorial on a video from Polyfjord, which can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktXD_WRMY8E" target="_blank">here.</a>
