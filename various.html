            <p>
                During module 5, there were a lot of seperate coding, animation- and modelling assignments to complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                For coding, we completed lots of Unity Learn assignments, learning about UI design, character movements, camera following, sound effects and gameplay mechanics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, for animation, we had to make walk- and jump cycles for a model, that being a flour sack. It had to seamlessly loop, and we had to give 
                the character a feeling of anticipation, recovery, weight and personality. I wanted the floursack to be a bit sad in personality, so that's what I went for in the movement.

            <p>
                Another animation we did was a simple circle reacting to the beat of a song. 
                This required many keyframes and listening closely to the drum of the beat, in order to time the circle enlarging and shrinking.

            </p>
            <p>
                For the final animation assignment, we had to model, texture, rig and animate an asset for our game. In my case, that would be <a href="chronosyphonics.html">ChronoSyphonics</a>.
                I decided to model and animate the gun for our game, which I spent about 20 hours on. 
                I wanted the gun to feel “alive”, so I made lots of moving parts that react and “breathe” when the trigger is pressed.
