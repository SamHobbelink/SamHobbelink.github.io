            <p>
                For the fourth project of Creative Technology, the goal was to create an art installation based on a specific human-invented technology. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Through lots of programming, physical computing, psychology and general building of the installation, 
                we made a fully-fledged automated spaceship simulator that functioned as an escape room. The message of this art installation was: 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Space travel makes us realise how alone and insignificant we are in comparison to the vastness of the universe, 
                but also makes our own troubles seem more trivial, and shows us that we are not alone in this insignificance.” - The project statement
            </p>
            <p>
                Normally, teams of six people would be made by the teachers during this module. 
                However, there was an opportunity to make your own groups of six, with the prerequisite that these consisted of 3 students from the 
                University of Twente and 3 students from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. This was called a “cross-country collab”, and I ended up taking on this challenge with two others, 
                collaborating with three VU students. 
                This was a very exciting experience and it was interesting to work with people that you do not usually see around, but that still have around the same skillset as you.
