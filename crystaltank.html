        <h2>CrystalTank: First videogame I ever coded and published</h2>
        <section class="project-description">
            <p>
                Within CreaTe, I have already coded many smalls games, especially in the language Processing (java-based). However, all the way back in 2018, 
                I designed, coded and published my own full videogame. It is a top-down arcade shooter with my own assets, 
                except for the background, a handful of sprites and some background music. I wrote my own code and ended up publishing the game on Newgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the game, you play as a blue tank, the “crystal tank”. Soon, enemies will start appearing. Red enemies have 1 health, 
                while pink enemies move faster and have 3 health. The game has animations, sound effects, power-ups, difficulty scalar, an endless mode, boss battles and music. 
                The player must continously fire at enemy tanks before they collide, by holding the space bar, and move using the WASD keys.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game was coded in Scratch and the sprites were created using the Vector editor within Scratch. 
                It took me around two weeks to set up the first version. I have updated the game numerous times to fix bugs, including a changelog for every patch. 
                I also made a touch-friendy mobile port of the game, requiring only a single action (holding down on the screen) to both fire and move in that direction.
            </p>
                It may not seem like much, but for a first project, I'm quite proud of it. On Newgrounds, it actually gained quite some traction, reaching almost 1000 plays and 
                accumulating some comments and 83 user votes. What's more, a friend of mine told me that his teacher at ROC van Twente used my game as a good example for a first game.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Adobe Flash Player shut down forever on December 31, 2021, I converted the game into HTML5 and uploaded it to Itch.io. 
                I should also note that while the game says it's “made by Goompro” and part of “ChickenOven Studios”, 
                Goompro is my online username and ChickenOven Studios was a small studio project with friends that ended up being disbanded before we even made a game together. 
                I made this game by myself.
