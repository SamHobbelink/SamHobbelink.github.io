                After just three days of starting module 5B of Creative Technology (an elective module), we had to create a fully-fledged videogame, all within two days. 
                Within the first three days, 
                we had a crash course on anything you need to make a videogame, like 3D modeling, coding in C#, working with Unity, making textures and designing sounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Groups could be freely made, four people per group. It was advised to have people with different skills in one group, 
                so someone who was good at sound design, another who's good at art, someone who's good at coding et cetera.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that, there was some brainstorming around the main theme: It's About Time. For this, we chose our game to be about a scientist who accidentally turned himself into a fly with a lifespan of five minutes, while he was researching time anomalies. His time anomalies scattered throughout his lab, and now he has to fix these anomalies, 
                before flying back into his own body and transforming back into a human. All while avoiding a fly's natural predators, such as spiders and birds.
            </p>

                If you would like to play the game yourself, you can do that <a href="https://goompro.itch.io/timeflys" target="_blank">here!</a>
            <p>
                This was just the beginning of the module. At the end of the module, 
                another game project will be held, but by then we have made a lot of progress in developing our game-development skills. 
                Also, we will have two full weeks of development time. I am very excited to show you the result of that in the near future.
