            <p>
                At Creative Technology, there's a course named Professional Development. 
                Every module, students pick a challenge to take on, to improve their functioning as a young professional.
            </p>
            <p>
                This module, I decided to improve my painting and drawing skills, 
                by taking the course Painting & Drawing at the Vrijhof cultural centre of the UT. The course took 8 sessions, with each session taking up three hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started out with sketching a painting I referenced from one of the present art books. A painting by Manet, “In His Studio Boat”. 
                I ended up picking up his style, Impressionism, which is based on quick “snapshots” of reality. 
                They maintain a realistic look but leave some interpretation to the individual, especially on small details in the background.
            </p>
                Secondly, I let myself be inspired by a music album, namely “I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love” from American punk-rock band “My Chemical Romance”. 
                I have always found this album really interesting, and I always pictured a grey car in the desert anytime I would listen to the song “Demolition Lovers” on the album. 
                I chose a colour palette similar to the one on the album cover and painted the image I saw in my head whenever I would listen to the lyrics of this song. 
                I think it reflects what I saw quite accurately!
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I decided to paint abstractly, and wanted to finish a painting in the last session. 
                I used a technique my mom uses a lot, as she's a painter by profession, called “intuitive painting”. 
                I started out with broad strokes across the canvas, until I eventually saw some sort of river appear in the brush strokes. 
                I accentuated the colours with blue and red, making a blend of purple. Afterwards, I stared at my abstract river and tried to paint everything I could see in my paint strokes. 
                I saw things ranging from ladders, a phoenix, a door, a book and many more. 
                It was quite challenging to paint without any reference or anchor point, but it taught me to improvise and work under time constraints. 
            </p>
            <p>I personally feel like this course taught me a lot about painting, different skills concerning them, the materials used, references and improvising. 
                I will be sure to incorporate my knowledge from this course in future prototypes I make for Creative Technology projects.</p>
            <p>
                Below, images of my paintings can be seen on the left, with the reference being on the right (except for the final painting, which has no reference).
