            <p>
                For Creative Technology's module 2 project, the goal was to design a prototype that would influence the world in a positive way, 
                based on scientific research, with the theme “Light and Life”. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After many brainstorming sessions, me and my team settled on the idea to make a window that adjusts the curtains and accentuates the light from outside with an LED bar, 
                based on the light outside. This is to create optimal lighting conditions for humans to be alert.         
            </p>
            <p>
                The window blinds and lights featured three modes: Relaxation, work and natural. 
                Relaxation is a warmer tone, designed to be easier on the eyes and maintain melatonin (sleep hormone) production at night. Work is brighter, colder light, 
                designed to keep the user alert, while natural mode mimics the hue of sunlight as closely as possible. 
                In addition, a step motor attached to the blinds. This moves the blinds down halfway for work mode, fully up for natural mode and fully down for relaxation mode.
            </p>
            <p>
                The prototype also featured an automatic dimming system: It takes the inside and outside lighting conditions with an LDR, 
                averages them, and brightens or softens the LED bar accordingly. Additionally, it also features a wake-up timer, that automatically turns on “natural” mode 
                at whichever time is set in the program. 
                Lastly, the “work” mode can't be turned on past 06:00 PM, as it could cause sleeping problems.     
            </p>

                Some photos of the prototype are shown below.
