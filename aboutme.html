                I have always loved tinkering with computers from a young age. 
                Be it programming games and applications, burning custom-made CDs, making my room smarter or 
                throwing together old PC parts and seeing if I can make videogames run on it, I have had a knack for technology for as long as I can remember.
                <br><br>
                In addition, creativity is also a strong feat of mine. 
                I love to draw, paint, make music and DIY in my spare time, especially when I can combine it with something technology related to create something new.
                <br><br>
                After graduating Dutch highschool Cum Laude, I went on to study Creative Technology at the University of Twente, where I also now live in a student home. 
                It has been a great experience here, being able to live and study on the UT's campus!
                <br><br>
                Currently, I have specialized to more digital media starting from the elective Module 5 of the study: Interactive Media. 
                With this, I gained a lot of experience in coding languages like C#, in addition to experience with 3D modeling and game engines such as Blender and Unity. 
                I loved the workflow there, and have had my eye on a career in this field ever since.
                <br><br>
                Aside from game design, I also have my eye on the field of education, as I have always loved teaching and telling people about technology and my studies (sometimes to their boredom). 
                It would be even more exciting if I could combine my passion for both of these fields in the future, perhaps in Serious Game Design.

                Creative Technology is a study that combines many different disciplines into one. Using electrical engineering, programming, psychology and computer science, 
                among others, we design solutions for problems in the world. 
                We iteratively design our products through phases of ideation, that lead to specification and eventually realisation and evaluation of the product.
                <br><br>
                It is quite a broad study, with options to specialize into specific fields starting with the second year. 
                Personally, I have decided to focus upon creating digital media, along with programming.
                <br><br>
                In the end, we usually create functional prototypes to embody our ideas, so that they can be expanded upon. 
                These are often accompanied by documentation, like research papers. On occasion, we also work with clients.
